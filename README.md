### Replacement of the NW2 library with lua based NW.
I think that its functionality is as similar to the original as possible. Tested both linux&windows. 
Created because of update 03.09.2019(issue https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/3978). Addons now work as before update.

# Install:
Put sh_nw3.lua to autorun shared folder, i.e. addons/<any_addon_name>/autorun/sh_nw3.lua
